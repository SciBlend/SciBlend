**SciBlend** is an extensible, Python-based toolkit developed to facilitate advanced scientific visualization workflows within Blender. It integrates Blender's rendering capabilities (Cycles & EEVEE) with functionalities for processing and visualizing complex computational data, aiming to bridge the gap often found between specialized data analysis tools and general-purpose 3D creation suites.

## üíæ Install


1. Download the platform zip above.
2. Open Blender > Edit > Preferences > Add-ons.
3. Select install from disk, select the zip, enable SciBlend.

After enabling, open View3D > Sidebar > SciBlend. The first panel is Advanced Core; other modules appear as separate panels within the same category.

## üß© Components included

- Advanced Core: X3D, VTK/VTU/PVTU, NetCDF, Shapefile import and utilities
- Shader Generator: scientific colormaps and shader creation
- Legend Generator: compositor-based legends
- Grid Generator: coordinate grids and guides
- Shapes Generator: compositor shapes
- Notes Generator: 3D annotations
- Compositor: camera, formats, and render helpers

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

- Blender 4.5.1 LTS+



## üîÑ Workflow Overview

SciBlend is designed to integrate into scientific visualization pipelines as follows:

1.  **Data Preparation (External, Optional):** Tools such as ParaView can be used for initial data processing, filtering, and preparation of large datasets. SciBlend includes ParaView macros to aid data export.
2.  **Import & Setup (SciBlend Advanced Core / Core):** Import static or time-varying datasets into Blender.
3.  **Material Application (SciBlend Shader Generator):** Apply or define shaders and colormaps based on data attributes.
4.  **Contextualization & Annotation (SciBlend Grid, Shapes, Notes Generators):** Incorporate coordinate systems and annotations.
5.  **Legend Generation (SciBlend Legend Generator):** Create legends to correlate visual elements with data values.
6.  **Scene Composition & Rendering (SciBlend Compositor):** Adjust camera settings, lighting, and render parameters using Cycles or EEVEE.
